## Description:
This application prompts the user through the creation of an easy, attractive README for their repos! It was created with **Node.js** using Inquirer. The goal is to quickly create a nice markdown file for your repos, so you can get back to coding. This is a **work in progress** and a lot more features are on the way.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Installation:
Clone this repo and run it locally to start making your **README**.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage:
Open your repo folder in **Terminal or CLI**, and enter:
```sh
npm i
node index
```
This will install the dependencies then start the application. Think about your ***markdown syntax*** when answering the prompts if you would like to include any special formatting, ~~text effects~~ or [links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in your description or instructions.
```javascript
// Include code examples, if you like:
const readMe = () => alert(`Read the README!`);
```
The script for this repo will take care of the rest of the content structure.
